1. Introduction
---------------

This  package  builds and  installs  shared  libraries for  the  CHICKEN
language;  it  implements  functions for  manipulating  Scheme  vectors.
CHICKEN is  a Scheme-to-C compiler  supporting the language  features as
defined in the ``Revised^5 Report on Scheme''.

  The  package targets  POSIX  systems.  The  package  depends upon  the
CHICKEN  eggs:  "matchable".   The  package depends  upon  the  external
packages: MMCK  Lang; MMCK  Exceptional Conditions.   To run  the tests:
this package depends upon the package MMCK Checks.

  The package uses the GNU Autotools  and it is tested, using Travis CI,
on both Ubuntu GNU+Linux systems and OS X systems.

  This package  should work with CHICKEN  version 5+; the last  time the
maintainer  bothered to  update this  paragraph: he  had tested  CHICKEN
5.1.0.

3. Install
----------

To install from a proper release tarball, do this:

    $ cd mmck-vectors-0.1.0
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

to inspect the available configuration options:

    $ ../configure --help

  The Makefile is designed to allow parallel builds, so we can do:

   $ make -j4 all && make -j4 check

which,  on  a  4-core  CPU,   should  speed  up  building  and  checking
significantly.

  The  Makefile supports  the  DESTDIR environment  variable to  install
files in a temporary location, example: to see what will happen:

    $ make -n install DESTDIR=/tmp/mmck-vectors

to really do it:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/mmck-vectors

  After the installation it is  possible to verify the installed library
against the test suite with:

    $ make installcheck

  From  a repository  checkout or  snapshot  (the ones  from the  GitHub
site): we must  install the GNU Autotools (GNU  Automake, GNU Autoconf),
then  we must  first run  the script  "autogen.sh" from  the top  source
directory, to generate the needed files:

    $ cd mmck-vectors
    $ sh autogen.sh

  After this the  procedure is the same  as the one for  building from a
proper release tarball, but we have to enable maintainer mode:

    $ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

  When compiling the environment  variable CHICKEN_FLAGS is available to
hand options to the compiler:

    $ make CHICKEN_FLAGS='-d3'

  Shared libraries will be installed under:

		       ${libdir}/chicken/$VERSION

where $VERSION is the version number of the installed CHICKEN.


4. Usage
--------

Read the documentation generated from  the Texinfo sources.  The package
installs the documentation  in Info format; we can  generate and install
documentation in HTML format by running:

   $ make html
   $ make install-html


A. Credits
----------

The  stuff was  written by  Marco Maggi.   If this  package exists  it's
because  of the  great GNU  software tools  that he  uses all  the time.
CHICKEN was  originally a creation  of Felix  L.  Winkelmann, it  is now
developed and maintained The CHICKEN Team.
